  # Robot Configuration Parameters - Kobuki
  max_vel_x: 0.3  # m/s, typical max speed for Kobuki
  min_vel_x: 0.0  # m/s, prevents the robot from stopping completely, ensuring forward motion

  max_vel_y: 0.0   # diff drive robot, no lateral movement
  min_vel_y: 0.0   # diff drive robot, no lateral movement

  max_vel_trans: 0.5  # m/s, aligned with the max linear velocity
  min_vel_trans: 0.1  # m/s, ensures minimal translational movement
  trans_stopped_vel: 0.05 # m/s, lower threshold for when the robot is considered stopped
  escape_velocities: true


  # Rotational velocities based on Kobuki's joint limits
  max_vel_theta: 1.5  # rad/s, increased for faster turns while within safe limits
  min_vel_theta: 0.2  # rad/s, ensures the robot turns with minimal angular velocity
  theta_stopped_vel: 0.1 # rad/s, threshold for when rotation is considered stopped
  
  acc_lim_x: 0.8 # m/s^2, higher acceleration for quicker speed changes
  acc_lim_theta: 3.0 # rad/s^2, faster rotational acceleration for agility
  acc_lim_y: 0.0 # diff drive robot, no lateral acceleration

  # Goal Tolerance Parameters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.1  #0.03  # rad, tighter tolerance for precise goal orientation
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.1  #0.05 # m, closer tolerance for goal position

  # Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 1.0  # s, reduce simulation time for quicker responses
  vx_samples: 7  # increased for better trajectory resolution
  vy_samples: 1   # diff drive robot, no lateral velocity samples
  vtheta_samples: 25  # more rotational samples for smoother turning

  # Trajectory Scoring Parameters
  path_distance_bias: 18.0      # higher weight for following the global path
  goal_distance_bias: 15.0      # increased weight for goal-seeking behavior
  occdist_scale: 0.18           # obstacle avoidance weight, reduced to balance path following and obstacle avoidance
  forward_point_distance: 0.325 # m, distance from the robot center to the forward point in the local plan
  stop_time_buffer: 0.2         # s, reduced to allow quicker stopping
  scaling_speed: 0.25            # m/s, moderate scaling of speed to prevent abrupt changes
  max_scaling_factor: 0.2       # slightly higher for more flexibility in scaling velocities

  # Oscillation Prevention Parameters
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.1 # m, lowered to prevent minor oscillations
  
  escape_velocities: true    # Allow escape velocities

  # Debugging
  publish_traj_pc: true
  publish_cost_grid_pc: true
  global_frame_id: odom
